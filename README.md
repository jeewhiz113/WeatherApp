# WeatherApp

This is a weather application that allows user to save their previously searched cities and render the current weather and its 5-day forcast to the screen.

A few things need debugging:
    -Buttons do not work.  They do not render the saved weather data in local storage.
    -When a string is entered with a space, it does not properly recognize the class.
    -Need to properly display the icons.
